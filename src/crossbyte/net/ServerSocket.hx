/**
	The ServerSocket class allows code to act as a server for Transport Control Protocol (TCP)
	connections.
	This feature is supported on all desktop operating systems, on iOS, and on Android.
	This feature is not supported on html5. You can test for support at run time using the
	ServerSocket.isSupported property.
	A TCP server listens for incoming connections from remote clients. When a client attempts
	to connect, the ServerSocket dispatches a connect event. The ServerSocketConnectEvent object
	dispatched for the event provides a Socket object representing the TCP connection between the
	server and the client. Use this Socket object for subsequent communication with the connected
	client. You can get the client address and port from the Socket object, if needed.
	Note: Your application is responsible for maintaining a reference to the client Socket object.
	If you don't, the object is eligible for garbage collection and may be destroyed by the runtime
	without warning.
	To put a ServerSocket object into the listening state, call the listen() method. In the
	listening state, the server socket object dispatches connect events whenever a client using the
	TCP protocol attempts to connect to the bound address and port. The ServerSocket object
	continues to listen for additional connections until you call the close() method.
	TCP connections are persistent — they exist until one side of the connection closes it (or a
	serious network failure occurs). Any data sent over the connection is broken into transmittable
	packets and reassembled on the other end. All packets are guaranteed to arrive (within reason) —
	any lost packets are retransmitted. In general, the TCP protocol manages the available network
	bandwidth better than the UDP protocol. Most AIR applications that require socket communications
	should use the ServerSocket and Socket classes rather than the DatagramSocket class.
	The ServerSocket class can only be used in targets that support TCP.
	@event close    Dispatched when the operating system closes this socket.
	@event connect  Dispatched when a remote socket seeks to connect to this server socket.

							to ports below 1024.

							default), the socket listens on all available IPv4 addresses. To listen on all available IPv6
							addresses, you must specify "::" as the localAddress argument. To use an IPv6 address, the
							computer and network must both be configured to support IPv6. Furthermore, a socket bound to
							an IPv4 address cannot connect to a socket with an IPv6 address. Likewise, a socket bound to
							an IPv6 address cannot connect to a socket with an IPv4 address. The type of address must
							match.

							  the underlying network socket (IP and port) is already in bound by another object or process.
							  the application is running under a user account that does not have the privileges necessary to bind to the port. Privilege issues typically occur when attempting to bind to well known ports (localPort < 1024)
							  this ServerSocket object is already bound. (Call close() before binding to a different socket.)
							  when localAddress is not a valid local address.
