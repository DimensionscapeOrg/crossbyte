/**
 * A static, thread-local utility class for scheduling time-based events.
 *
 * `Timer` provides access to a scheduler bound to the current thread.
 * All timer operations are handled by the scheduler attached to this thread.
 * 
 * This API only works in threads that are managed by a CrossByte runtime instance (such as via `CrossByte.runThread()`).
 * It will throw an error if accessed from a thread that has not been initialized with a `CrossByte` instance.
 * 
 * Threads created manually using `sys.thread.Thread.create()` or other non-CrossByte threading APIs
 * will fail at runtime when calling these timer methods unless a scheduler is explicitly bound.
 *
 * This design allows each CrossByte-managed thread to maintain its own isolated timing system.
 * For unified, thread-safe timer APIs, consider using `crossbyte.utils.GlobalTimer` instead.
 * 
 * @see crossbyte.utils.GlobalTimer
